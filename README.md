# three-orbitcontrols

> is the three.js OrbitControls from official repo examples

All credits goes to [OrbitControls.js][original_orbitcontrols] contributors.
I have just **stolen** the code and modified to export it as a module
so you can do

```javascript
import OrbitControls from 'three-orbitcontrols'
```

or

```javascript
var OrbitControls = require('three-orbitcontrols')
```
